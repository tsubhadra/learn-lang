1 scenario (1 passed)
3 steps (3 passed)
0m00.008s (executing steps: 0m00.000s)

How to Run It Again
cd /Users/suthirumavalavan/learn/learn-lang/cucumber/lessons

# Run the test
npm test

# Or run directly with cucumber-js
npx cucumber-js 01-hello-world.feature --require 01-hello-world-steps.js

Key Points
Note: Cucumber is a testing framework, not a standalone programming language. It requires:
A .feature file with Gherkin syntax (behavior specifications)
Step definitions in a programming language (JavaScript, Ruby, Java, etc.)
The step definitions contain the actual executable code
This is a fully functional, executable Cucumber test that demonstrates the Hello World pattern in a BDD context! âœ“
